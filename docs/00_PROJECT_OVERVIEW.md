# AI Travel Agent - Project Overview

## Vision Statement

Build a superior AI travel agent that overcomes the limitations of existing AI travel planners by providing accurate, real-time, and personalized travel recommendations through an intelligent single-agent system.

## Problem Statement

Current AI travel planners suffer from three critical failures:
1. **Inaccuracies & Hallucinations**: Outdated information leads to wrong recommendations
2. **Data Staleness**: Static training data can't handle dynamic travel information
3. **Impersonality**: Stateless design provides generic, one-size-fits-all recommendations

## Solution Architecture

### Core Innovation: Hybrid Data Strategy
- **Real-time APIs**: Amadeus Flight Search API for accurate flight pricing
- **Browser Automation**: Nova Act for closed platforms (Airbnb, Booking.com)
- **Maps Integration**: Google Maps API via AgentCore Gateway for restaurants and attractions
- **Intelligent Orchestration**: Single Strands Agent with multiple specialized tools

### Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Aceternity UI
- **Backend**: Single AgentCore Runtime with integrated tools
- **AI Core**: Amazon Bedrock Nova Premier via Strands + AgentCore Runtime
- **Flight Data**: Amadeus Flight Offers Search API
- **Accommodation Data**: Nova Act browser automation (Airbnb + Booking.com)
- **Restaurant/Attraction Data**: Google Maps API via AgentCore Gateway
- **Authentication**: Amazon Cognito with JWT tokens
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Real-time Flight Data**: Direct Amadeus API integration for accurate pricing
2. **Comprehensive Accommodation Coverage**: Browser automation accesses Airbnb and Booking.com
3. **Rich Local Information**: Google Maps integration for restaurants and attractions
4. **Personalization**: AgentCore Memory for cross-session user preferences
5. **Reliability**: Single-agent architecture prevents coordination failures
6. **Scalability**: AgentCore Runtime auto-scaling
7. **Trust**: Transparent source attribution for all recommendations
