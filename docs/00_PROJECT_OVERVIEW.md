# AI Travel Agent - Project Overview

## Vision Statement

Build a superior AI travel agent that overcomes the limitations of existing AI travel planners by providing accurate, real-time, and personalized travel recommendations through an intelligent multi-agent system.

## Problem Statement

Current AI travel planners suffer from three critical failures:
1. **Inaccuracies & Hallucinations**: Outdated information leads to wrong recommendations
2. **Data Staleness**: Static training data can't handle dynamic travel information
3. **Impersonality**: Stateless design provides generic, one-size-fits-all recommendations

## Solution Architecture

### Core Innovation: Hybrid Data Strategy
- **Free APIs**: Google Flights, Yelp Fusion for foundational data
- **Browser Automation**: Nova Act + AgentCore Browser Tool for closed platforms (Airbnb, Booking.com)
- **Real-time Intelligence**: Strands Agents orchestrating multiple data sources

### Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Aceternity UI
- **Backend**: Python + AWS Lambda + API Gateway
- **AI Core**: Amazon Bedrock Strands Agents + AgentCore Runtime
- **Browser Automation**: Amazon Nova Act SDK + AgentCore Browser Tool
- **Authentication**: Amazon Cognito
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Real-time Data Access**: Only system with access to Airbnb/Booking.com via browser automation
2. **Personalization**: AgentCore Memory for cross-session user preferences
3. **Reliability**: Task decomposition prevents hallucination cascade
4. **Scalability**: Serverless architecture with parallel browser sessions
5. **Trust**: Transparent source attribution for all recommendations

## Success Metrics

- **Accuracy**: >95% factual correctness of recommendations
- **User Satisfaction**: Net Promoter Score >50
- **Performance**: <30 second response time for comprehensive searches
- **Coverage**: Access to all major travel platforms (flights, hotels, activities)

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Individual travelers seeking personalized trip planning
- **Secondary**: Travel agents wanting AI-augmented workflow tools
- **Future**: Corporate travel managers and travel booking platforms

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-6)**: Foundation & MVP - Basic flight search
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 7-14)**: Multi-platform integration with browser automation
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 15-22)**: Personalization & memory integration
4. **Phase 4 (Weeks 23-30)**: Production optimization & scaling

## Expected Outcomes

By project completion, we will have:
- A production-ready AI travel agent that users trust
- Breakthrough browser automation capabilities for travel data
- Scalable architecture handling thousands of concurrent users
- Foundation for expanding into corporate and B2B markets
