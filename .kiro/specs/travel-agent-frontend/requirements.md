# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a React-based frontend interface for the travel agent system. The application will provide users with a landing page, authentication capabilities via AWS Cognito, and a chat interface to interact with the travel orchestrator agent. The frontend will be built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS with Aceternity UI components, and deployed via AWS S3 and CloudFront using CDK.
